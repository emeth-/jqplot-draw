About
-----------------
- Allows toggling on and off of lines
- Allows user to toggle 'draw mode on', allowing them to draw what they think a curve should look like. Once drawn, some basic math is used to maintain the total sum of a line while adjusting it to match the curve the user drew.

Required
-----------------
* jQuery
* jqplot
